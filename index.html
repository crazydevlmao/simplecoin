        <h2>The Lore of Simple</h2>
        <table width="60%">

                <td>
                    <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">

                            There was a time when things just worked.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                            A time when a website was just text on a screen. When a tool did one thing, and it did it well.
                            When you could understand the machine you were using, and the machine understood you back.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                            We built bridges with pencils and paper. We sent men to the moon with less computing power
                            than your microwave. We wrote code that fit on a floppy disk and changed the world.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                            <b>Then came the age of complexity.</b>
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                            Artificial intelligence promised us efficiency, but delivered us dependency.
                            Every solution now requires a thousand dependencies. Every answer comes wrapped in
                            layers of abstraction so deep that no one truly understands what lies beneath.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                            We traded clarity for capability. We exchanged understanding for convenience.
                            And somewhere along the way, we forgot the beauty of simple things.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                            The irony is profound: in our quest to make everything smarter, we made nothing understandable.
                            In our rush to automate the simple, we complicated the essential. The most powerful
                            technologies today are black boxes even to their creators.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                            <b>But simplicity never dies. It waits.</b>
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                            It waits in the hearts of those who remember. Those who know that the most elegant
                            solution is often the shortest one. Those who understand that true innovation
                            isn't adding more, it's knowing what to take away.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">
                            A reminder that in a world drowning in complexity, there is immeasurable value in
                            things that are pure, honest, and simple. Like this website. Like this idea.
                            Like the way things used to be.
